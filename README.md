Introduction

Google Colab, short for Google Colaboratory, is a cloud-based platform provided by Google for writing and executing Python code. It offers a Jupyter notebook environment that allows users to run code in a collaborative and interactive manner, directly from their web browser. Google Colab provides access to free GPU and TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) resources, making it particularly useful for machine learning and data analysis tasks that require significant computational power.

Importing Libraries:

To import libraries in Google Colab, you can use the same syntax as you would in any Python environment. Here's how to import some common libraries:

1. NumPy: Import NumPy with the alias 'np':

   python
   import numpy as np
   

2. Pandas: Import Pandas with the alias 'pd':

   python
   import pandas as pd
   

3. Matplotlib: Import Matplotlib for plotting:

   python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   

4. TensorFlow: Import TensorFlow for deep learning tasks:

   python
   import tensorflow as tf
   

Sample Code:

Here's a sample code cell demonstrating how to import NumPy and create a simple array:

python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Print the array
print("NumPy Array:", arr)


This code imports the NumPy library, creates a NumPy array containing the numbers 1 through 5, and then prints the array. You can run this code cell in a Google Colab notebook by clicking the play button or pressing Shift+Enter.
